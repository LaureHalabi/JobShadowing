# JobShadowing
A matching algorithm used for Queen's University's Alumni Relations Committee for a Job Shadowing Program.

### Event Description
For the Job Shadowing Program, we paired one or two students to one alumni that works in their hometown (or wherever the student is over Fall/Winter Reading Break). One day over the Fall/Winter Reading Break (either the Thursday or Friday of that break), the student accompanied the alumni to their work and shadowed them throughout the day. The goal was to give students the opportunity to see what a typical day in a certain field might look like. 

### How will students be matched with alumni?
Students will submit an application to participate in the Job Shadowing program. The committee will be matching selected students to the alum that shares a common interest, whether it be similar disciplines, career fields, or interests. This program will ensure that the students and alumni that are paired are in the same region. If there are students or alumni who are unable to get matched, the program will output a excel sheet of rejected students and alumni and the committee will try to connect them through email or other means of communication.
